# Build and Test, See how Mobile Center helps you ship apps faster

# Overview

Mobile Center brings together multiple services, commonly used by mobile developers, into a single, integrated product. You can build, test, distribute, and monitor your mobile apps and easily add backend cloud services to scale your app to millions of users on demand.

# Objectives

- Fork a GitHub project.
- Link a GitHub account with Mobile Center.
- Set up an automated build and test of a mobile project.
- Review build and test results.

# Prerequisites

- A GitHub account ( [http://github.com](http://github.com))

# Intended Audience

This Quick Start Challenge is intended for developers who are familiar with the process of mobile development. It does not require any experience with development itself.

# Task 1: Fork a copy of the demo project

1. Log in to your GitHub account at [https://github.com](https://github.com).
2. Search for the **"myweather.forms"** repo.

# Task 2: Set up a build in Mobile Center

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the **Mobile Center** at [https://mobile.azure.com](https://mobile.azure.com).
2. Click **Connect with GitHub**. This is the easiest way to link your accounts so that Mobile Center has access to your projects.

12. Enable the option to **Sign builds**. As part of this, you'll need to upload the **Build.keystore** file available in the **C:\Labs** directory under the code for this lab. Both passwords are **"Build\*1234"** and the **Alias** is **"Build2016"**.

13. If available, select the option to **Start your trial now!**.

14. Select the option to **Run a lunch test on a device**. This will validate that the build loads as expected. Note that it does take around ten minutes. Also select **Distribute builds** to notify group members when a build becomes available. Click **Finish setup** to kick off the first build.

6. The test review page provides a screenshot of the end of the test, along with defaults on what device was used and information about memory and CPU usage. (Want a free t-shirt? Take a screenshot of this page and follow the instructions at the end of the lab.)

8. If you check the email associated with your account (probably your GitHub email), you'll see a new message from **Visual Studio Mobile Center** announcing the new build's availability. You could then click through to learn more and get the new build.

9. Want a sweet new **Mobile Center t-shirt**? Take a screen shot of your successful launch test and tweet it out to **#build2017 @MobileCenter**. Then show the booth staff and they'll hook you up!
